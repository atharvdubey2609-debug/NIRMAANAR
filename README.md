# NIRMAANAR – AR Layout Prototype

## Overview
NIRMAANAR is a prototype AR-based layout assistant
designed to reduce manual marking errors in construction.

This MVP demonstrates overlaying a digital floor plan
onto a live camera feed.

## Problem
Manual construction layout marking using chalk lines
leads to misalignment and costly rework.

## Solution
A mobile-based AR concept that projects digital layouts
onto the physical construction site.

## Features
- Live camera preview
- Floor plan image upload
- Adjustable scaling
- Overlay visibility toggle
